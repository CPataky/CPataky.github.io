                Q: How do I get from Madrid or Seville to Sanlúcar de Barrameda?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> We suggest either taking a plane or train from Madrid or Seville to Jerez de
                Frontera. For a flight, Iberia and Vueling are both good airline options which fly into Jerez de la
                Frontera Airport (XRY) or you may also take a <a href="http://www.renfe.com/" target="new">RENFE</a>
                train to the Jerez de la Frontera train station. Taxi services are readily available at both the airport
                and train station for you to arrange transportation to the hotel. Train ticket resources: <a

                Q: I will be spending some additional time in Madrid. Any recommendations?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Steven Alexander has compiled <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bHwmU8GFvpx"
                    target="new">a thorough list</a> of some of his favorites in Madrid he has found over his many years
                of travel to the area.

            <p class="question">
                Q: My phone won’t have data service while I’m in Spain, how do I find my way around without a map app?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> We recommend downloading Google Maps in advance if you’re concerned with data usage.
                Instructions for both Android and iOS can be found in this <a
                    href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co" target="new">support article</a>. We
                recommend downloading maps for Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Chipiona, El Puerto de Santa María, Jerez, and any
                cities you may be traveling through on your way to Sanlúcar de Barrameda.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: How will I get from the airport or train station on the date of departure?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> There will be buses hired to transport guests from the hotel to the airport and
                train station on Saturday, April 6. Details to come on the schedule of the buses. Please note, if the
                bus schedule does not work with your travel times, you will be in charge of arranging your own transport
                via taxi. The hotel will be able to assist you in scheduling a taxi.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: Do I need to rent a car?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> We do not recommend that you rent a car, nor will you need one during your stay. You
                should travel to the event via taxi and from there, we will be providing transportation via bus service
                to all of our events. Most importantly, we encourage all attendees to be safe and never drive after
                consuming alcohol. We are providing bus transportation to and from all Running of the Scales events with
                your comfort and safety in mind.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: Can you explain more about bus transportation during the event?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> We have secured multiple buses from a top local tour company, which will be driven
                by a team of professional drivers throughout the week. A bus schedule will be posted in your welcome
                packet which you will receive upon arrival, as well as the hotel lobby. We will have multiple buses for
                each event with a staggered departure times and arrival times. Remember to refer to your bus schedule
                for clear departure times for each event.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: How do I use a taxi in Spain?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Taxis are readily available and your best bet for traveling around these towns
                farther than you would like to walk. Please be aware that the proper taxi etiquette in Spain is to
                provide a complete address for your destination (e.g. Hotel Palacio de Arizón, Calle Banda Playa, 125,
                11540 Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Cádiz, Spain) so that the driver may enter the address into their GPS.
                Giving the taxi driver a vague location (e.g. “the corner of Calle Banda Playa and Av. Quinto
                Centenario”) or the name of your destination, as you may do for an American taxi driver, will likely
                cause confusion, extra travel time, and excessive charges. Although many cabs now accept credit cards,
                it is a good idea to have some Euros available for payment just in case.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: Can I use Uber or Lyft to get around?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> There are no ride-sharing services operating in the area but taxis are readily
                available. The hotel can help you get a taxi if needed.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: What do I have to pay for?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Once you check in the hotel on Tuesday, we will take care of your lodging and all
                meals that are listed in the itinerary through Saturday morning when the event ends. We will be
                providing transportation to and from all of our events. You do not need a rental car. Any incidentals
                during your stay will be your responsibility as well as travel to/from the event, such as taxis.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: What is the weather like in Sanlúcar de Barrameda in April?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Expect temperatures ranging from 60°F to 70°F in the day and dropping to the
                mid-to-low 50s at night. Rain is unlikely but possible.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: What should I pack to wear?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> No need for formal attire for this event. Be casual and comfortable! We do recommend
                bringing a hat and sunscreen because there will be outdoor events in direct sunlight.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: Are there any activities that I need to sign up for in advance?

            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> There will be seminars held throughout the week which you will have an opportunity
                to sign up for upon check-in at the hotel.

                <strong>A:</strong> Yes, Hotel Palacio de Arizón has an in-room safe.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: What about a nearby grocery store and/or pharmacy?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Once you arrive, you will receive a Welcome Packet that will contain information on
                local places of interest including grocery, market, pharmacy, hospital, etc. The hotel reservationist is
                also a wealth of local knowledge.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: I have food allergies or special dietary requests, who should I tell?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> We ask that all special requests go through your sales person so we may adequately
                care for you in advance. Please let us know in advance of any allergies or dietary restrictions you may
                have so we can work to accommodate you.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: Will there be breakfast?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes, a full American breakfast will be served each morning with coffee and tea.
                Since lunch in Spain tends to begin much later than the US, we recommend having a hearty breakfast.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Q: Can I visit any of the wineries before or after Running of the Scales?

            <h1>Sherry Glossary</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="full_box">
            <h3>Almacenista</h3>
            <p>
                Small sherry stockholder. Historically, almacenistas would sell their wines to the big sherry houses,
                where they would be blended into soleras to create the house style. In 1997, laws that prevented
                almacenistas from bottling their own sherry were changed, making it possible for small producers to sell
                their own wine.
            </p>
            <h3>Aroba</h3>
            <p>
                The traditional unit of measurement used in Jerez. One aroba equals 16.6 liters.
            </p>
            <h3>Arrope</h3>
            <p>
                An ancient method of imparting sweetness and color to a base wine made by reducing unfermented grape
                must to 20% of its original volume.
            </p>
            <h3>Aspilla</h3>
            <p>
                A dipstick that is used to measure how much liquid there is in a barrel.
            </p>
            <h3>Bota</h3>
            <p>
                The name used for a barrel in Sherry Country.
            </p>
            <h3>Capataz</h3>
            <p>
                The cellar-master, who keeps track of all the barrels and designates which barrels are going to make
                which style of sherry.
            </p>
            <h3>Criadera</h3>
            <p>
                Each level or tier in a solera system is called a criadera (the word literally translates to nursery).
            </p>
            <h3>En Rama</h3>
            <p>
                "Raw" wine bottled straight from the cask without fining or filtration. While many sherries claim to be
                "en rama", few actually are. True en rama is best enjoyed at the bodega, but if bottled must be
                refrigerated and consumed within 4-6 months of bottling date.
            </p>
            <h3>Flor</h3>
            <p>
                The layer of yeast that spontaneously forms on top of the wine in some barrels of sherry.
            </p>
            <h3>Levante</h3>
            <p>
                Hot wind from the south-east.
            </p>
            <h3>Llamada</h3>
            <p>
                The specific markings written on the barrels by the capataz usually indicating the solera and the number
                of botas in it.
            </p>
            <h3>Mosto</h3>
            <p>
                The unfortified base wine base before it becomes what is locally considered “wine” after fortification
